## Search by language

**Notes:**

* Projects that contain a star `ðŸŒŸ` in their link are languages that I have the most repositories written in

* Projects that contain a checkmark `âœ…` in their link are languages I know well

* Projects that contain a lightbulb `ðŸ’¡` in their link are languages I know the best

Other notes:

I originally created this language link list, as GitHub only lets you select from a dropdown of less than 35 programming languages when searching for repositories in a users profile for the recent projects only. This list gives easy access to searching for projects written in these languages, as I have projects in over 50 different programming languages.
